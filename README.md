## Rules

The goal is to find the hidden word with as few penalties and attempts as possible.

Each turn, players must either enter a letter if they think it is in the word, or a word if they believe they have guessed the hidden word.

- If they guess a letter correctly: they receive +1 penalty.

- If the letter is not in the word: they receive +3 penalties.

- If they guess the wrong word: they receive +5 penalties.
